## Description

This mobile app supports users exploring outdoor environments through cycling. It records GPS coordinates, visualizes paths using OpenStreetMap, and fetches nearby scenic amenities such as drinking water spots, cycle parking, and landmarks. The app promotes sustainable commuting and recreational wellness.

Data is stored using a local Room database, while user preferences such as API keys and identifiers are stored using SharedPreferences. Firebase Authentication is used for user login.
